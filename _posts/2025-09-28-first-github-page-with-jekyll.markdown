# Introduction

This blog is a compilation of notes I took while going through this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fV01b0duZwU) on YouTube on how to build your first website on GirHub with Jekyll.

# Installing Ruby and Jekyll
1. Go to [Ruby Installer](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/) and get the latest installer (including DEVKIT) for Windows.
2. Run the installation with the default settings; when it asks to install the MSYS toolchain, choose option 3: MSYS and MSYS2. Once the install is done, it'll ask the same set of questions again, hit ENTER to exit.
3. Since I will be using the bash terminal to run ruby, modify the `.bashrc` to include the newly installed ruby binaries in the system path,

    ```bash
    export PATH=${PATH}:/c/Ruby34-x64/bin
    ```

4. run `gem update`.
5. Install `jekyll` and `bundler`.
    ```bash
    $ gem install jekyll bundler
    ```
6. run `jekyll -v`, you should get a response like `jekyll 4.4.1`

# Create a Blank Repository on GitHub
1. Log into your github account
1. Create a new repository with the following name: `<github_username>.github.io`

![Create a new GitHub Repository][img_create_repo]

# Using Jekyll to create a barebones page
We are going to force jekyll to create a page in our github webpage repository, `vishalcoelho.github.io` in my case.

1. cd into the root of the repo
1. Create a new site

    ```bash
    $ jekyll new --skip-bundle .
    **Conflict**: C:/Users/savio/repositories/vishalcoelho.github.io exists and is not empty.
    Ensure C:/Users/savio/repositories/vishalcoelho.github.io is empty or else try again with `--force` to proceed and overwrite any files.
    ```
    > :warning: It's complaining about the repo being empty, use `--force`

    ```bash
    $ jekyll new --skip-bundle . --force
    New jekyll site installed in C:/Users/savio/repositories/vishalcoelho.github.io.
    Bundle install skipped.
    ```

    <!-- ![Jekyll creates a blank project][img_jekyll_blank] -->
    <img
        style="display: block;
               margin-left: auto;
               margin-right: auto;
               width = 30%;"

1. Edit the *Gemfile*:
   1. comment `gem "jekyll", "~> 4.4.1"` as GitHub is currently pinned to v3
   2. Uncomment `gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins` and add the version for github-pages, which you can fine on [GitHub versions](https://pages.github.com/versions/)

      `gem "github-pages", "~>232", group: :jekyll_plugins`
   3. Run `bundle install`

        ```bash
        $ bundle install
        [DEPRECATED] Platform :mingw, :x64_mingw, :mswin is deprecated. Please use platform :windows instead.
        Fetching gem metadata from https://rubygems.org/...........
        Resolving dependencies...
        ...stuff...
        Bundle complete! 7 Gemfile dependencies, 100 gems now installed.
        Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.
        ```

2. Verify changes in `Gemfile.lock` then add this file to `.gitignore`

# Visualizing changes locally

Run `bundle exec jekyll serve` to serve up the site locally, and `Ctrl+C` to shut it down when done live editing.

   ![Host site on local server][img_local_server]


# Using different themes

You can find more themes at [GitHub Pages Themes](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll). To use a theme simply edit the _config.yml

1. Change theme from the default `minima` to `jekyll-theme-<theme>`. For example, if i wanted to change to the hacker theme, the line would look like

```theme: jekyll-theme-hacker```

1. This alone isn't sufficient to render locally

![Fail to use theme locally][img_jekyll_serve_fail]

It is complaining about layouts `page`, `home` not existing. `hacker` only supports the `default` and `post` layouts (check the _layout folder in the theme's repository)

So, change all `home` & `page` -> `default`

1. We are missing the links `about`, `contact`, so how do we customize this theme?
   1. create a new folder `_layouts` where we  will override the theme. Create an `index.html`
   1. lets borrow from the [Minima](https://) theme, specifically `home.html` and place it in our newly created `index.html`; we will be overriding the `default` layout
   1. update index.markdown to point to the new layout in the front matter.

   change `layout:default` to `layout:index`

   1. Copy `Hacker's` [default layout theme](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker/blob/master/_layouts/default.html)
   and edit it to alter how your main page shows up. Having our own altered version of the default layout will override GitHub's version.
